    question: "What is Angular?",
    answer:
      "Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It provides powerful features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and component-based architecture.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does data binding work in Angular?",
    answer:
      "Angular provides two-way data binding using [(ngModel)] and one-way data binding using interpolation {{ }} and property binding [property]. This enables automatic synchronization of data between the model and view, making it easier to build dynamic applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Angular directives?",
    answer:
      "Directives are special markers in HTML that tell Angular how to behave. There are three types: structural directives like *ngIf and *ngFor that modify DOM layout, attribute directives like ngClass that change element appearance or behavior, and component directives that create custom elements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Angular CLI?",
    answer:
      "Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful development tool that helps in creating, developing, and managing Angular applications. It provides commands for generating components, services, pipes, and other features, along with built-in development server and build optimization tools.",
